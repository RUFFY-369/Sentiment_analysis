# Sentiment_analysis
This repo consists of sentiments classification script with tensorflow2.For the training of the model,I have used the IMDB dataset available in 'tensorflow_daatsets'.The script basically classifies a movie
review into three categories namely 'positve','neutral' and 'negative'.Some sample texts are also included in the scripts for testing the model.Both the jupyter notebook and python script are there.
